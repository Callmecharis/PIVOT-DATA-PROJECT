## DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION
In the process of data cleaning and preparation i performed the following actions
1.	data loading
2.	retriving missing data
3.	Data cleaning 
4.	data summerisation
5.	Data extraction
## DATA SOURCE
The primary source of the data is gotten from ms excel and this an open source data that can easily be downloaded from an open source online
## DATA ANALYSIS
1.	SELECT * FROM TABLE 1
2.	WHERE CONDITION =TRUE
3.	SELECT * =IFS(J2<=20,"LOW",J2<=50,"MEDIUM",J2>50,"HIGH")
WHERE CONDITION =TRUE
4.	Removal of unnecessary column 14 and 15 using power Bi
5.	Key transformations: when the data is transformed on Power Bi we checked on the View tab for Column quality, value distribution,, column profile, column distribution, column statistics
Using Power Bi making use of Dax function to generate Total ROI
We created new measure on the table model using conditional column to get Region Number```
## EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
EDA involved the exploring of the data with visualisation on Power BI to answer some questions about the data such as;
  * Total region by revenue
  * Top five markets and their revenue
  * Bottom five stores by units sold
  * Top ten store by revenue

  * sales category by market
  * top 3 market by sum of total ROI
  * Units sold by stores by Total ROI
  * Sales Category by Market
  * Region by Sales Category
  *
